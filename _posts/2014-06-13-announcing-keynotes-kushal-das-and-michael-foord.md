We are proud to announce our keynote speakers for PyCon India 2014!

As the old saying goes, well begun is half done. What better way to
kick off each day of the conference than by letting experienced Python
practitioners talk about the best things in Python? Last year, the bar
for keynotes was raised higher than ever before with Kiran
Jonnalagadda and Kenneth Reitz giving two fantastic talks.

Ladies and gentlemen, introducing this year's keynote speakers -
[Kushal Das](http://kushaldas.in/aboutme.html) and [Michael Foord](http://www.voidspace.org.uk/)!
