It is that time of the year once again when the entire Python community comes together to make sure PyCon India gets better and better. We have already announced the number of [proposals and various demographics](http://in.pycon.org/2014/blog/143-proposals-we-got/) related to it.

Each one of you, whether you got started with Python last month or you've been around for 20 years, have something to contribute. That mutual respect is what holds the Python community together. Head over to the [funnel](http://in.pycon.org/funnel/2014/) and make your voice be heard.

You can refer to our [Proposal Review](http://in.pycon.org/2014/blog/the-proposal-review-process/) blog post to understand what the votes mean. Looking at the current votes, you can get a feel of what the conference is going to be like. It is absolutely in your power to influence which talks go through and which talks don't.

If you feel like you need more information on any of the talks, feel free to comment on any of the proposals. The speaker will get back to you. On second thought, be proactive in having a discussion on the funnel. This will help the speaker curate his content better.

You would have noticed many conferences having the trouble of scheduling a fan favorite talk in a smaller hall and thereby causing an overflow of people there. However, if you vote and show your interest right now, the schedule can be prepared in such a way that the more popular talks can be given the bigger halls.

Don't think twice. [Vote now](http://in.pycon.org/funnel/2014/)!
