Being a community run event, sponsors are the ones who make PyCon India a reality. The support shown by many organizations over the past years and even this year is heart warming, and much appreciated by the entire Python community, in India and abroad. Apart from letting the world know your generosity by supporting the conference, by sponsoring, the benefits go a long way than just the love of the community.

Judging from last year's turnout and this year's excitement, we are sure to have over a 1000 Pythonistas around for the conference this time. From Software Engineers to Architects, and Senior Managers to Administrators, and even the so called programming rockstars and ninjas, are sure to turn up at the event. If you're a company who has a development team building on Python and looking to grow your team or maybe looking to build more visibility for your product, [PyCon India 2014](http://in.pycon.org) is the place to be at.

The deadline for sponsorship is on August 15th. [Please find the sponsorship brochure here](http://in.pycon.org/2014/sponsorship-prospectus.pdf) or mail contact@in.pycon.org for more details.
