The fee is Rs. 800 for the main event. This is the most sought after ticket of the event. So make sure to get your hands on one of these asap!

Student Registration
---

The fee is Rs. 800 for the main event. This type of ticket is valid only for students. They are required to show their college/university identity card at the venue.

We’re allowing students to purchase tickets at this nominal amount for the next three months. Students are what make our event more fun and exciting!


**Note**: *The above costs do not cover workshops as well. You need to purchase tickets for them seperately. Once the workshops are finalised, we’ll publish further information.*
