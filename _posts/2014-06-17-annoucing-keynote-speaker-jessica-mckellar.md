Jessica McKellar is an entrepreneur, software engineer, and open
source developer from San Francisco, California, USA. She is a Director
for the Python Software Foundation, PyCon North America's [Diversity
Outreach Chair](https://twitter.com/jessicamckellar/status/413009020522221568), and a maintainer for several open source projects,
including OpenHatch and the Twisted event-driven networking engine. For
her outreach efforts in the Python community, she was awarded the
