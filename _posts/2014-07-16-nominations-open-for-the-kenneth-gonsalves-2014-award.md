The first ever Kenneth Gonsalves award was presented to Baiju Muthukadan last year. Read about last year's award ceremony [here](http://in.pycon.org/blog/baijum-first-kenneth-gonsalves-award-recipient).

This award is instituted by PSSI and PSF in the name of our late friend and mentor, Kenneth Gonsalves who passed away in August 2012. KG, as he is fondly known in the community, was the founder of the Indian Python Software Society. This award is for the ones who are doing exemplary work in Python programming language, its development/adoption/advocacy in India.

With [PyCon India 2014](http://in.pycon.org/) just two months away, it is time for us to nominate a worthy candidate for this year's Kenneth Gonsalves award. The nominations are open now. If you would like to put forward the name of an Indian citizen who is deserving of this great honor, please visit the following Nomination form and propose their name.
