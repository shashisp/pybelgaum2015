This year, with a whooping 143 proposals, the review process will be all the more interesting. Once again a big shout out to all the Python enthusiasts out there who took the time to propose, vote and hold discussions on the Funnel.

The review process will be done in 2 phases:

* Phase 1: Each reviewer will give a +1, 0 or -1 for each proposal. Once this is done, any talks with no negatives will move onto phase 2 and those with 3 negatives or greater will be rejected.

* Phase 2: The proposals will be reviewed in groups. The final list will be confirmed once this phase is over. The reviewer will reach out to the proposer through funnel for any queries he/she might have.

### What do votes mean? ###

+1 - The topic sounds good and the proposal is solid. This means the reviewer is willing to put his/her reputation on the line in favor of the proposal.

0 - The topic is good and the proposal is solid. The speaker is capable of correcting any deficiencies, and significant number of attendees want it.

-1 - The proposal is not upto the mark.

### Points taken into consideration by reviewers for each evaluation ###

* Will I attend the talk if it is selected?

* Are there a significant number of attendees who want to attend the talk?

* Does the author know enough about the topic?

* Is the proposal too ambitious for the time allotted?

As stated on the [funnel](http://in.pycon.org/funnel/2014/), the accepted proposals shall be announced on 30th June, 2014.
