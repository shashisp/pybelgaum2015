"Good things come to those who wait"

While the logistics team is running around getting all the variables in place, the proposal reviewers are having a hard time making up their minds. They are taking their time to reach out individually to many of the talk proposers and gauging their knowledge as well as their presentation skills before making a final call. This process, applied to 143 proposals, each of really good quality, is taking a little more time than we expected it to. However, this will ensure top notch quality for the selected talks and hence, will pay off in the long run.

We had earlier announced that the accepted proposals would be announced on June 30th, 2014. We are extending the proposal acceptance announcement to July 15th, 2014.

So bear with us for a little while more and wait for the big announcement soon!
