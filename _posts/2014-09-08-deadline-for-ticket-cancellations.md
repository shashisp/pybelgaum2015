With the event drawing closer, some of you folks might have one or the other engagement unexpectedly popping up, putting your presence at [PyCon India 2014](http://in.pycon.org/) at jeopardy. As much as it breaks our heart to see you go, we understand the situation and are willing to accept a cancellation or transfer.

However, having hit 1000+ registrations so far, we need to prepare well in advance in order to make the conference a gratifying experience for all. This means organizing the venue, registrations, food and tons of other small things which all goes into the prep.

Hence, the last date for ticket cancellations is 20th September, 11:59PM. After that, until 24th September, you will have the option to transfer your tickets. Please mail __tickets@in.pycon.org__ or __abdulraufhaseeb@gmail.com__ with your ticket along with the Name & Email address of the person whom you want the ticket to be transferred to.

If you do neither of these, then you'd better show up for the conference. Otherwise there might be some of us treating ourselves to a second helping for desserts!
